This project implements a rudimentary online bus ticket booking system using a combination of frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and a Go backend. The frontend provides a user-friendly interface with input fields for personal details (first name, last name, email), travel information (source and destination cities, date), and the number of tickets. The styling, implemented with CSS, incorporates a background image relevant to travel, a semi-transparent orange container for the form, and basic styling for form elements to enhance user experience. JavaScript plays a crucial role in populating the source and destination city dropdown menus, dynamically fetched from a predefined list. More importantly, it handles the form submission process. Upon submission, the JavaScript code uses the Fetch API to send the collected form data as a POST request to the /book endpoint of the Go backend.

The Go backend is responsible for processing the booking requests. It receives the form data, parses it, and performs a simple validation check to prevent bookings where the source and destination cities are identical. After processing, the backend generates a JSON response containing a status (success or error) and a corresponding message. This JSON response is then sent back to the frontend. The JavaScript code on the frontend receives this JSON response, displays the message to the user within a designated message area, and resets the form if the booking was successful. The Go backend also handles serving the static frontend files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), effectively functioning as a web server. This setup demonstrates a basic client-server architecture where the frontend handles user interaction and display, while the backend manages data processing and logic. This simple application provides a foundation for more complex features such as database integration for persistent data storage, more robust input validation, seat selection, and payment gateway integration in a real-world booking system.
